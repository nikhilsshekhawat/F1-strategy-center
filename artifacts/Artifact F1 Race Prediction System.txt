🎓 Key Points for Presentation
Opening:

"I developed an F1 race prediction system using neural networks that achieves 95.54% accuracy on historical data from 1950-2024."

Technical Highlights:

"I trained and compared 5 different machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. The Neural Network performed best with a 3-layer architecture."

Innovation:

"The system features a hybrid architecture - when the ML API is available, it uses the 95.54% accurate Neural Network. When offline, it automatically switches to a rule-based fallback achieving 91.87% accuracy."

UI Excellence:

"I designed a professional futuristic interface using glassmorphism principles, inspired by modern F1 team control centers."

Practical Value:

"Users can analyze unlimited drivers, export results in 4 formats, and get instant predictions. The system processes 27 engineered features but only requires 8 simple inputs from users."
